# Hashing Techniques - 

## MD5
 - The MD5 hashing algorithm is a one-way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns as output a fixed-length digest value to be used 
   for authenticating the original message.
 - MD5 produces an output of **128-bit** hash value. (32 characters long)
 - MD5 hashes are no longer considered cryptographically secure, and they should not be used for cryptographic authentication.
